## Notes for Development
1. **Server**: The website server is always running and accessible. You do not need to include code for starting the server. Simply remind me to check it if necessary.
2. **Backend and Database**: Backend and database functionality will be added after the frontend development is complete. Keep this in mind while structuring the project.
